## Data Extraction Service

This django web application is developed for uploading data in ".csv" format to a postgresql database and serving (rendering) the data from the DB in an html.

### Getting Started

To enable this app function properly, install the dependencies in the `pipenv`. Simply run:

```
pipenv shell
pipenv install
```


Once all the dependencies have been installed, proceed as follows:

- Create a postgres DB
- Run upload_data app
- Launch DataTask server

The details of the steps are provided as follows:

### Create a Postgres DB

-  First install postgresql 12.2 (incase it's not installed already).

    One way of doing this is to download the postgresql app from https://postgresapp.com/downloads.html
    or use homebrew by running:

    `brew install postgresql`

    After installing postgresql, start all postgresql services from terminal by either running (postgres must be running at all times):

    `pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start`
    or
    `brew services start postgresql`

- Second, create a new postgres database named `task` using:

    `CREATEDB task;`

    Afterward, launch the `task` db shell by running:

    `psql task`

    create username and password for the database using:

    `CREATE USER admin1 with encrypted password 'admin1';`

    grant all privileges of the db to USER `admin1` using:

    `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE task TO admin1;`

    grant the USER the role to create new db using:

    `ALTER USER admin1 CREATEDB;`


### Run upload_data app

By completing the first step, we have created a db `task`. The next step is uploading csv data to postgres db. The app for achieving this is `upload_data`.

In order to upload the data, we need to create a db table which will be accessed by our django project model, we need to:

- Create db table 

    create db table `Taskdata` in the db `task` by running the following:

    `python upload_data/create_db_table.py`

- Upload csv data to db table

    start the web server using:

    `python manage.py runserver`

    open another terminal and goto project directory

    `cd data-extraction-service`

    to upload the `task.csv` data into table `Taskdata`, run:

    `python upload_data/stack_data.py`

    we can now turn off the web application server (Ctrl + C)

### Launch data-extraction-service server

The main app in `data-extraction-service` is `showdata`. It contains the data model, views, and url routes

- Again launch the server using:

    `python manage.py runserver`

- to view the uploaded data in html, go to:

    `http://127.0.0.1:8000/index.html/`

- to access the admin page, go to:

    `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`
  
The admin page login details is:

```
username: admin
password: user1234
```
